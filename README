== Description
   This is an interface for creating and/or modifying Windows shortcuts.

== Requirements
   Ruby 1.8.2 or later.
   The win32ole library (part of the Ruby standard library).

== Installation
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)
   
== Synopsis
	require 'win32/shortcut'
   include Win32
	
   Shortcut.new('c:/test.lnk') do |s|
      s.description       = 'test link'
      s.path              = 'c:/winnt/notepad.exe'
      s.show_cmd          = Shortcut::SHOWNORMAL
      s.working_directory = 'C:/'
   end
   
== Notes
   This code uses win32ole + wscript behind the scenes. The original C code
   is not distributed as part of the release, but is still retained in the
   CVS repository under the 'ext' directory should anyone ever need it.

== Acknowledgements
   The original win32-shortcut package was largely based on Aldo Calpini's
   Win32::Shortcut Perl module, and I copied some of the documentation as
   well.
   
   The current version (0.2.0 and later) is based on a patch by Jano Svitok.
